# advent-of-code-2022

In this repository I attempt to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by completing the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) problems.

## Quickstart

You can run any of the files in the `src/bin` folder using:

```shell
cargo run --bin <bin>
```

For example, to run `day01-part1.rs`, you would run:

```shell
cargo run --bin day01-part1
```
